App for smart plants

This repository contains all the code necessary to build and run the Android application, granted you open it in Android studio.

For the documentation, you can find it in the code itself, or opening [the dartdoc generated documentation](https://git.dc.turkuamk.fi/edu.veronica.zanella/smart-plants-app/-/blob/master/doc/api/index.html). The second option is advised since dart shows the actual code implementation of the functions and classes that you are looking at.

The main idea of the application is to be able to create a user, some hubs and some plants attached to those hubs.
Each plant will be requesting data from the backend and will display the soil moisture, temperature, humidity and light intesity every 5 minutes.
